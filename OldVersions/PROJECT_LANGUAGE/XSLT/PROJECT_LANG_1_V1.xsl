<!-- Project language file 1
For: seanpm2001/Learn-XSLT
About:
I decided to make XSLT the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-XSLT) as XSLT is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the XSLT programming language. It only makes sense to XSLT the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
